# MinimalMediatR

MinimalMediatR is a lightweight and extensible implementation of MediatR.

## âœ¨ Features
- Send/Receive pattern (`IRequest<T>` + `IRequestHandler<T, R>`)  
- Publish/Subscribe event model (`INotification` + `INotificationHandler<T>`)  
- Middleware support via `IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>`
- Auto-registration with `AddMinimalMediatR(...)`

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```csharp
services.AddMinimalMediatR(typeof(MyHandler).Assembly);
```

## ðŸ§± Sample Query

```csharp
public class GetUserQuery : IRequest<User> 
{ 
    public int Id { get; set; } 
}

public class GetUserQueryHandler : IRequestHandler<GetUserQuery, User>
{
    public Task<User> Handle(GetUserQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
        Task.FromResult(new User { Id = request.Id, Name = $"User {request.Id}" });
}
```

public class UserCreatedEvent : INotification

{
    public Task Handle(UserCreatedEvent notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
